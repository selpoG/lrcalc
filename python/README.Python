Python bindings for the Littlewood-Richardson Calculator
========================================================

First install the LR Calculator.  Make sure that Python3 anc Cython3 are
also installed.  Then compile the bindings module:

python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

Test that it works as follows:

python3 -c "import lrcalc; print(lrcalc.mult((2,1),(2,1)))"
